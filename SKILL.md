# Intelica — Competitive Intelligence Skill

> **⚠️ DATA PRIVACY NOTICE:** This skill sends the provided company name, URL, description, and context to the Intelica API (api.intelica.dev), a third-party service. Do NOT submit confidential business plans, proprietary strategy, regulated data (HIPAA, GDPR-sensitive), or personally identifiable information. Use only for publicly available companies and markets. Paid calls ($0.05–$1.00 USDC) are made autonomously when a payment method is configured — set budget controls before enabling autonomous use.

Intelica returns structured competitive intelligence for a specific named company or market. Invoke only when the agent has a clear, scoped target and the user has approved external data submission.

## When to use

- Agent needs competitor analysis on a **specific named company** before a strategic decision
- Founder needs a market entry report for a specific new geography
- Agent is evaluating a **specific** DeFi protocol before entering a position
- Sales agent needs a battlecard for a **specific** upcoming demo
- VC agent screening a **specific** investment opportunity
- Compliance officer evaluating regulatory risk for a **specific** company or product

## When NOT to use

- General market questions without a specific named target
- Internal strategy or confidential business planning
- Regulated or sensitive data (medical records, financial PII, legal documents)
- When local reasoning or public knowledge is sufficient
- Without explicit user approval for third-party data submission

## Budget controls (important for autonomous agents)

- Standard analysis: $0.05 USDC per call
- Elite analysis: $1.00 USDC per call
- Batch (up to 10): $0.20 USDC
- Always use `/demo` (free) to validate before enabling paid autonomous calls
- Set `operator_id` to enforce daily budget limits per pipeline
- Results cached 6 hours — same company twice costs once

    { "text": "Coda collaborative doc platform", "mode": "acquisition" }
  ]
}
```

## Context Modes

| Mode | Price | Use when |
|------|-------|----------|
| `competitive` | $0.05 | Standard competitor analysis (default) |
| `fundraising` | $0.05 | Investor narrative, TAM, traction signals |
| `partnership` | $0.05 | Strategic fit — complement or rival? |
| `acquisition` | $0.05 | Due diligence — moat, technical risk |
| `market_entry` | $0.05 | Market gaps, saturation, barriers to entry |
| `crypto_protocol` | $0.05 | DeFi moat, tokenomics, regulatory risk |
| `market_entry_execution` | $1.00 | Execution plan — partners, budget, week-1 actions |
| `venture_screening` | $1.00 | Investment thesis + deal-breakers |
| `regulatory_compliance` | $1.00 | EU AI Act, GDPR, HIPAA exposure |
| `risk_assessment` | $1.00 | Business model stability, operational risk |
| `sales_enablement` | $1.00 | Battlecard + objection handler |

## Response trust protocol (M2M)

The response includes root-level fields for programmatic trust validation:

```json
{
  "sources": ["url1", "url2"],
  "confidence": "high | medium | low",
  "market_score": {
    "threat_level": "high | medium | low",
    "moat_strength": 0.72,
    "agent_recommendation": "monitor | counter | partner | acquire"
  },
  "analysis": { ... }
}
```

Agent decision pipeline:
1. Check `sources[]` — if fewer than 2 URLs, treat confidence as low
2. Check `confidence` — if low, do not execute autonomous actions
3. Check `market_score.agent_recommendation` — use as primary action signal
4. Read `analysis{}` for full context

## Output fields

```json
{
  "analysis": {
    "company_or_product": "string",
    "positioning_summary": "string",
    "target_customer": "string",
    "core_value_props": ["string"],
    "user_pain_points": ["string"],
    "detected_competitors": ["string"],
    "unique_angle": "string",
    "confidence": "high | medium | low",
    "sources": ["url1", "url2", "url3"],
    "market_score": {
      "threat_level": "high | medium | low",
      "moat_strength": 0.0,
      "market_maturity": "emerging | growing | mature | declining",
      "agent_recommendation": "monitor | counter | ignore | partner"
    }
  },
  "model": "claude-sonnet-4-6 | claude-haiku-4-5-20251001",
  "tier": "elite | standard",
  "mode": "string",
  "detected_language": "en | es | pt | de | fr | it | ja | ko | zh"
}
```
